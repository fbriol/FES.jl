# FES.jl

This repository contains a version of the FES2014 tidal prediction code
written entirely in Julia and based on the
[C library](https://github.com/CNES/aviso-fes).

One example of how to use this package is documented on
[this page](https://github.com/fbriol/FES.jl/blob/main/docs/src/index.md).
